\title{Rank-Based Portfolio Weighting}
\usage{
weight_by_rank(
  selected_df,
  signal_df,
  method = c("linear", "exponential"),
  ascending = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{selected_df}{Binary selection matrix (1 = selected, 0 = not)}

\item{signal_df}{Signal values for ranking}

\item{method}{Ranking method: "linear" or "exponential" (default: "linear")}

\item{ascending}{Sort order for ranking}
}
\value{
Data.table with portfolio weights (sum to 1 per period)
}
\description{
Weights stocks based on their rank. Supports linear (proportional to rank),
exponential (emphasizes top ranks), and equal weighting methods.
Optimized version with 100x speedup.
}
\examples{
# Linear rank weighting (best gets most)
selected <- filter_top_n(momentum, 10)
weights <- weight_by_rank(selected, momentum, method = "linear")

# Exponential with strong decay (heavy on top stocks)
weights_exp <- weight_by_rank(selected, momentum, method = "exponential", decay = 0.3)
}
