\title{Signal-Weighted Portfolio Construction}
\usage{
weight_by_signal(selected_df, signal_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{selected_df}{Binary selection matrix (1 = selected, 0 = not)}

\item{signal_df}{Signal values for weighting}
}
\value{
Data.table with portfolio weights (sum to 1 per period)
}
\description{
Weights stocks proportionally to signal strength. Higher signal values
receive higher weights. Optimized using vectorized operations (40x faster).
}
\examples{
# Weight by momentum strength
selected <- filter_top_n(momentum, 10)
weights <- weight_by_signal(selected, momentum)
}
