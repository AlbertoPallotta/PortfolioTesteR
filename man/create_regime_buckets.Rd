\title{Convert Continuous Indicator to Discrete Regimes}
\usage{
create_regime_buckets(
  indicator,
  breakpoints,
  labels = NULL,
  use_percentiles = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{indicator}{Numeric vector or single-column data frame with indicator values}

\item{breakpoints}{Numeric vector of breakpoints. If all values are between
0 and 100, treated as percentiles; otherwise absolute values}

\item{labels}{Optional character vector of regime names. If NULL, generates
automatic labels based on number of buckets}

\item{use_percentiles}{Use percentiles instead of fixed breakpoints}
}
\value{
Factor vector with regime assignments for each observation
}
\description{
Transforms continuous indicators (like VIX, volatility, correlation) into
discrete regime categories for adaptive strategy behavior. Supports both
percentile-based and absolute value breakpoints.
}
\examples{
# Create VIX-based market regimes
vix_regimes <- create_regime_buckets(
  vix_data$VIX,
  breakpoints = c(20, 30),
  labels = c("calm", "normal", "stressed")
)

# Use percentiles for automatic thresholds
vol_regimes <- create_regime_buckets(
  volatility,
  breakpoints = c(25, 75),  # 25th and 75th percentiles
  labels = c("low", "medium", "high")
)

# Four regimes with auto-generated labels
correlation_regimes <- create_regime_buckets(
  correlations,
  breakpoints = c(-0.2, 0.3, 0.7)
)  # Creates: low, normal, elevated, extreme
}
